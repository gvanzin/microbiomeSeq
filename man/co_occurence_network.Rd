\item{qval_threshold}{Cut off for "fdr" adjusted p-values.}

\item{grouping_column}{(Required). Character string specifying name of a categorical variable that is preffered for grouping the information.
information.}

\item{rhos}{(required). A vector specifying thresholds for correlation between co-occuring pairs of features.}

\item{select.condition}{(optional). A character string speifying name of a desired condition/group. If not supplied, co-occuence analysis
is performed amongst all conditions present in the grouping variable.}

\item{physeq(Required).}{A \code{phyloseq} object containing merged information of abundance,
taxonomic assignment, sample data including the measured variables and categorical information
of the samples, and / or phylogenetic tree if available.}

\item{method.}{A character string for the correlation method to be used; options include: "cor" and "bicor"}
}
\value{
Files of visual representation of the network showing subcommunities (identified by colors),
network statistics and file containing pairwise corrrelations of taxa in under different conditions.
}
\description{
This function uses co-occurence pattern analysis to identify co-occuring features/taxa in community 
data under specified environmental conditions. Co-occurence is measured as positive correlation whose threshold(s)
can be specified as indicated in arguments section. Amongst these features, pairwise co-occurences which are outstanding within sub communities
are detected. p-values generated during pairwise correlations are adjusted for multiple comparisons 
by false discovery rate. The network statistics used to assign importance of taxa/features include betweenness, closeness,
and eigenvector centrality.
